# Deep-learning

         1.)The foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects.  
         2.) Learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more.
         3.) Work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing.  
         4.) Master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. 
         5.) Practice of the deep learning technicques in python and tensorflow.
